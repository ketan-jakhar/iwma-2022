								Human Activity Recognition - Dance Modelling and Analysis
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-muted fw-bold">Abstract:</span>
								Dance experts often view dance as a hierarchy of information,
								spanning low-level (raw images, image sequences), mid-levels
								(human poses and bodypart movements), and high-level (dance
								genre). We propose a Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition
								framework (HDVR). HDVR estimates 2D pose sequences, tracks
								dancers, and then simultaneously estimates corresponding 3D
								poses and 3D-to-2D imaging parameters, without requiring ground
								truth for 3D poses. Unlike most methods that work on a single
								person, our tracking works on multiple dancers, under
								occlusions. From the estimated 3D pose sequence, HDVR extracts
								body part movements, and therefrom the dance genre. The
								resulting hierarchical dance representation is explainable to
								experts. To overcome noise and interframe correspondence
								ambiguities, we enforce spatial and temporal motion smoothness
								and photometric continuity over time. We use an LSTM network to
								extract 3D movement subsequences from which we recognize dance
								genre. For experiments, we have identified 154 movement types,
								of 16 body parts, and assembled a new University of Illinois
								Dance (UID) Dataset, containing 1143 video clips of 9 genres
								covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels.
								Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms outperform
								the state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation methods, which also
								enhances our dance recognition performance.

								<span class="text-muted fw-bold">Title of the talk : </span
								>Privacy-aware Multimedia Analytics
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-muted fw-bold">Abstract :</span>In this talk,
								we present our research on privacy-aware multimedia analytics.
								We will present three works covering different aspects of
								multimedia analytics. The first work is about privacy protection
								against machines. Utilizing machine learning and big data,
								algorithms often act as a tool for privacy violation, by
								automatically selecting content with sensitive information, such
								as photos that contain faces or vehicle license plates. The key
								idea is to perturb images using adversarial machine learning to
								protect image attributes privacy, while ensuring the images are
								not degraded. We conducted an experimental study to explore
								factors that influence human sensitivity to visual changes,
								which led to the concept of a human sensitivity map. Using this
								map, a human-sensitivity-aware image perturbation model is
								developed that can subtly alter an image such that sensitive
								attributes like gender are misclassified. The second work
								concerns privacy-preserving analytics on images. Attributes such
								as emotions, gender and age in images and videos are important
								for many applications. Existing methods extract this information
								from faces in the images. However, faces raise serious privacy
								concerns as they reveal people's identity. We first did an
								eye-tracking based human study of age, gender, and emotion
								prediction of people in images under various identity preserving
								scenarios - obfuscating eyes, lower face, head or the full face.
								Motivated by this study, we successfully developed a deep
								learning model for attributes prediction under
								privacy-preserving conditions and we present its results. The
								third work concerns training machine learning models where data
								sets cannot be shared due to privacy regulations (e.g., from
								medical studies). A simple yet unconventional approach for
								anonymized data synthesis can enable third parties to benefit
								from such valuable data. We propose learning implicitly from
								visually unrealistic, task-relevant stimuli, which are
								synthesized by exciting the neurons of a trained neural network.
								Neuronal excitation serves as a pseudo-generative model, and can
								be extended to inhibit representations that are associated with
								specific individuals, thus providing privacy. The stimuli data
								is then used to train new classification models. Experiments on
								MNIST and sleep apnea data show that these models offer
								protection against adversarial association and membership
								inference attacks. We will end with a general discussion on
								privacy concerns related to multimedia analytics.

								Dr. Saurabh Kumar has received his Bachelor of Engineering
								(B.E.) degree in Computer Science and Engineering from
								Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University, Bhilai,
								India, in 2010, M. Tech in Computer Science from Birla Institute
								of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India, in 2013, and PhD in
								Computer Engineering from Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute
								of Technology, Surat, Gujarat, India, in 2019. He has been
								working on the problems of optimized deployment strategy and
								localization of nodes and events using IoT for post disaster
								management. He has successfully published 13 conference papers
								and 4 journals with leading publication houses like ACM, IEEE,
								Springer, Elsevier, and Oxford University Press in these fields.
								He has been an active researcher in the fields of Internet of
								Things, Collaborative data processing, multi-agent systems and
								wireless sensor networks. Recently, he was conferred with 2020
								Wilkes Award for best paper (runner-up) by Oxford University
								Press for his novel work on localization of events for post
								disaster management. In the past, he served as an IT Officer for
								two years with mining business of the Aditya Birla Group. He is
								currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the Department of
								Computer Science and Engineering at The LNM Institute of
								Information Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.
