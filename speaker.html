								Multimedia Analytics
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-muted fw-bold">Abstract :</span>In this talk,
								we present our research on privacy-aware multimedia analytics.
								We will present three works covering different aspects of
								multimedia analytics. The first work is about privacy protection
								against machines. Utilizing machine learning and big data,
								algorithms often act as a tool for privacy violation, by
								automatically selecting content with sensitive information, such
								as photos that contain faces or vehicle license plates. The key
								idea is to perturb images using adversarial machine learning to
								protect image attributes privacy, while ensuring the images are
								not degraded. We conducted an experimental study to explore
								factors that influence human sensitivity to visual changes,
								which led to the concept of a human sensitivity map. Using this
								map, a human-sensitivity-aware image perturbation model is
								developed that can subtly alter an image such that sensitive
								attributes like gender are misclassified. The second work
								concerns privacy-preserving analytics on images. Attributes such
								as emotions, gender and age in images and videos are important
								for many applications. Existing methods extract this information
								from faces in the images. However, faces raise serious privacy
								concerns as they reveal people's identity. We first did an
								eye-tracking based human study of age, gender, and emotion
								prediction of people in images under various identity preserving
								scenarios - obfuscating eyes, lower face, head or the full face.
								Motivated by this study, we successfully developed a deep
								learning model for attributes prediction under
								privacy-preserving conditions and we present its results. The
								third work concerns training machine learning models where data
								sets cannot be shared due to privacy regulations (e.g., from
								medical studies). A simple yet unconventional approach for
								anonymized data synthesis can enable third parties to benefit
								from such valuable data. We propose learning implicitly from
								visually unrealistic, task-relevant stimuli, which are
								synthesized by exciting the neurons of a trained neural network.
								Neuronal excitation serves as a pseudo-generative model, and can
								be extended to inhibit representations that are associated with
								specific individuals, thus providing privacy. The stimuli data
								is then used to train new classification models. Experiments on
								MNIST and sleep apnea data show that these models offer
								protection against adversarial association and membership
								inference attacks. We will end with a general discussion on
								privacy concerns related to multimedia analytics.
