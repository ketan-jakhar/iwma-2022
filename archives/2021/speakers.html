					Title of Talk : On Exploiting Multimodal Information for Machine
					Intelligence and Natural Interactions - with examples from Health
					Chatbots
				</h5>
				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong> The Holy Grail of machine
					intelligence is the ability to mimic the human brain. In computing, we
					have created silos in dealing with each modality (text/language
					processing, speech processing, image processing, video processing,
					etc.). However, the human brain’s cognitive and perceptual capability
					to seamlessly consume (listen and see) and communicate
					(writing/typing, voice, gesture) multimodal (text, image, video, etc.)
					information challenges machine intelligence research. Emerging
					chatbots for demanding health applications present the requirements
					for these capabilities. To support the corresponding data analysis and
					reasoning needs, we have explored a pedagogical framework consisting
					of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and perceptual computing.
					In particular, we have been motivated by the brain’s amazing
					perceptive power that abstracts massive amounts of multimodal data by
					filtering and processing them into a few concepts (representable by a
					few bits) to act upon. From the information processing perspective,
					this requires moving from syntactic and semantic big data processing
					to actionable information that can be weaved naturally into human
					activities and experience.
				</div>
				<div>
					Exploration of the above research agenda, including powerful use
					cases, is afforded in a growing number of emerging technologies and
					their applications - such as chatbots and robotics for healthcare. In
					this talk, I will provide these examples and share the early progress
					we have made towards building health chatbots that consume
					contextually relevant multimodal data and support different
					forms/modalities of interactions to achieve various alternatives for
					digital health.  I will also demonstrate the strong role of domain
					knowledge and personalization using domain and personalized knowledge
					graphs as part of various reasoning and learning techniques.

					Title of Talk : How to Exploit Deep Learning for Multimedia
					Applications
				</h5>
				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong>
					Deep learning opens another renaissance of artificial intelligence
					that is a long dream of human-beings. It gives us a great opportunity
					to handle the difficult problems in many applications including
					multimedia. In order to be successful in practical applications of
					deep learning, we need to make use of several models together. In this
					talk, I will give the key idea of deep learning models, and present a
					generative model via an adversarial process that shows the amazing
					demonstration of performance for multimedia. It can simultaneously
					train a generative model to capture the data distribution, and
					discriminative model to estimate the probability that a sample came
					from the training data. In addition, I will explain several techniques
					to exploit the latent space inside deep learning models. Latent space
					in a deep learning model provides an important representation on the
					problem at hand, which propels efficient data analysis and creative
					application. In order to verify them, we present three applications
					such as predicting electric power demand, detecting malware for cyber
					security, and detecting anomalies in video sequences: 1) the
					state-explainable autoencoder for encoding power demand up to the
					present and transcribing them into the latent space, 2) the latent
					space predefined with a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distribution
					for enhancing the performance of malware generation and detection, and
					3) an adversarial autoencoder for detecting various outliers in the
					surveillance video.

					Title of Talk : Evolutionary Algorithms: What, How andWhere
				</h5>
				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong> In the context of artificial
					intelligence (AI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is considered as a
					generic population-basednature inspired search and optimization
					method. An EA is an adaptive computational procedure modelled on the
					mechanics of natural evolution. Taking inspiration from biological
					evolution, the method uses selection, crossover and mutation as
					operators.   Candidatesolutions  to the  optimizationproblem  play the
					role of individuals in a population, and the fitness(objective)
					function determines the quality of the solution. Evolution of the
					population takes place by repeating above mentioned operators till
					termination. Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating
					solutions to all types of (search) problems because they ideally do
					not make any assumption about the underlying  fitnesslandscape . EAs
					can also be extended for many-objective framework where the aim is to
					simultaneously optimize several conflicting objectives, e.g.,
					travelling distance, time, cost, comfort, risk etc. Under
					multi-objective framework no single point is considered as an optimal
					solution; rather, the optimal solution can only be a set of
					non-dominated and trade-off ones. In the present lecture initially an
					introduction will be given on evolutionary algorithms (EAs). This will
					be followed by the applicability of EAs in solving various complex
					real life problems, mostly NP-hard (e.g., Knapsack problem,
					Classification, Clustering, Image Enhancement etc.), with special
					emphasis on Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) under multi-objective
					scenario.

					Title of Talk : E-LEARNING FOR ENHANCED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE HEARING
					IMPAIRED CHILDREN
				</h5>
				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong>  Hearing-impaired (HI) children are
					often found to lag behind in language comprehension. It was observed
					in a survey conducted in and around the city of Kolkata, India, that
					HI children consequently face difficulties in understanding arithmetic
					word problems as well. This survey, and the statistical analysis of
					its outcome, constitutes the first part of this lecture. The second
					part deals with a possible remedy for the problem. To this end, a new
					assistive technology-based app on Android platform is being developed
					and constructed to help speech-impaired and HI persons to improve the
					depth and breadth of vocabulary knowledge in Indian Sign Language
					(ISL). This, we suggest, will be highly effective through the learning
					of relevant antonyms along with synonyms, and mapped into semantic
					connotation via sign inputs to recognize the symbols, in absence of
					sound through some visual clues (Sign Video).

				<strong>MNIT, Jaipur </strong>
				<h5 class="title">Title of Talk : Support Vector Machines</h5>
				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong>

					Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models that primarily
					analyze data for binary classification (can be extended to
					multiclass). Developed in 1992 at AT &T Bell Labs by Boser, Guyon and
					Vapnik et al. An SVM maps training examples to points in space such
					that it maximises the width of the margin between the two classes. New
					examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong
					to a class based on which side of the margin they fall.
				</div>
				<div>
					In this leacture we will learn linear classification: Given a set of
					training examples, each marked as belonging to one of tthe wo classes,
					how to build a maximum margin hyperplane that assigns new examples to
					one class or other for linearly separable data. This will be followed
					by extending it for separating non-linear data using the Kernel trick.
					Hands on examples will be solved for better understanding of SVM
					classifier.

					Intelligent under water surveillance is one of the most active
					research areas in computer vision. The aim is to uncover hidden
					patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information that can
					be used to make better decisions for designing a surveillance system
					for analyzing underwater movements. Researchers are urged to develop
					intelligent systems to efficiently extract information from under
					water data. Analyzing the data generated from a single or multiple
					camera source are large in nature again they contains several complex
					scenarios and needs a lot of effort for processing in real time
					environment. The different difficult situations may include:
					non-static background, occluded environmental condition, haze in
					water, poor visibility, etc. where videos are recorded for a longer

					Title of Talk : Hyperspectral Images and its Applications
				</h5>

				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong> Development of hyperspectral
					sensors is a significant breakthrough in remote sensing. Hyperspectral
					imaging sensors acquire a set of images from hundreds of narrow and
					contiguous bands of the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to
					the infrared regions. Images captured by hyperspectral sensors have
					ample spectral information to identify and distinguish spectrally
					unique materials. They have the potential for more accurate and
					detailed information than any other type of remotely sensed images. On
					the other hand, multispectral sensors measure reflected radiation from
					a surface at a wide and separated wavelength bands. The narrowness and
					contiguous nature of the measurements are more important for
					hyperspectral sensors than the number of measured wavelength bands.
					There are various applications of hyperspectral images like target
					detection, material identification, mineral mapping, vegetation
					species identification, mapping details of surface properties etc. In
					this lecture, we will know about hyperspectral images, it applications
					and how machine learning techniques have been used to take decision
					from hyperspectral images.

					Topic : IoT Emulation with Cooja (Basics and Advance)
				</h5>

				<div>
					<strong>Brief Abstract : </strong>   The evolution of the Internet of
					Things (IoT) has led researchers to design, develop, and work on
					different simulation and emulation platforms to realize the potentials
					of the IoT environment. The Internet of Things provides an environment
					to perform effective sensing, actuation, and communication among the
					cyber-physical systems. This requires an understanding of the
					implementation potentials of devices deployed in the region of
					interest. This involves machine-level programming at the physical
					layer and communication at the network layer to realize the real-time
					service delivery at the application layer. One of the crucial aspects
					of research in the field of IoT requires developing an environment
					that utilizes the standard protocols of IoT. In this context, this
					hands-on session discusses the concepts, installation, and emulation
					using the Contiki-Cooja platform. This session discusses the different
					experiments using device-level programming on the Cooja platform.
